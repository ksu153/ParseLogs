# ParseLogs
The Log Parser is a Python script that allows you to extract and categorize log entries from a log file. It identifies two types of log entries: errors with exceptions and errors without exceptions, and creates a table with columns for Date, State, and Description. You can use this tool to quickly analyze and organize log data.

## Features
